# Analytics

Visits and events are tracked via Google Analytics. The following taxonomy aids in the correct classification of each event:

| Interaction       | Event Name      | Category | Action | Label | Value                                          |
| ----------------- | --------------- | -------- | ------ | ----- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Activate a seal   | activate_seal   |          |        |       | (Number 1-16 representing activated seal)      |
| Deactivate a seal | deactivate_seal |          |        |       | (Number 1-16 representing activated seal)      |
| Reset board       | reset_board     |          |        |       | (Number representing the total seals reset)    |
| Shuffle board     | shuffle_board   |          |        |       | (Number representing the total seals shuffled) |

All information pushed into Google Analytics is in lowercase format.
